At the moment, Windows 10â€™s implementation of the OpenSSH client does not have the ssh-copy-id command available. However, a PowerShell one-line command can mimic the ssh-copy-id command and allow you to copy an SSH public key generated by the ssh-keygen command to a remote Linux device for passwordless login.
use the below PowerShell one-line command to copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub public key to a remote Linux device. Replace the {IP-ADDRESS-OR-FQDN} with the IP address or FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the remote Linux device you would like to copy the public key to.
`type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh {IP-ADDRESS-OR-FQDN} "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"`
